## Step 1: Download the Project

Clone this repository using `git clone git@github.com:just-an-experiment/viva-translate.git`

Alternatively, you can download the [latest zip package](https://github.com/just-an-experiment/viva-translate/releases/tag/1.0.0) and unzip it. 

## Step 2: Download Node Dependencies

To install project dependencies, you can use `pnpm` (recommended) or `npm`:

## Step 3: Add API Keys and Environment Variables
This project uses DeepL for translations, OpenAI for transcription summaries, and Gladia for speech-to-text transcriptions. 

Here is how to get your API Keys from each provider in order to run the project:
- DeepL
	- [Create a developer account](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro/change-plan#developer) - it'll ask for a credit card but it won't charge you upfront
 	- Get API Key from [https://www.deepl.com/en/your-account/keys](https://www.deepl.com/en/your-account/keys)
- OpenAI

- Gladia
	- [Create a developer account](https://app.gladia.io/)
 	- Get API Key from [https://app.gladia.io/account](https://app.gladia.io/account)


Before compiling the project, you should configure the environment variables. Copy the `.env.example` file, rename it to `.env`, and replace the placeholder values with your own:

```
ENVIRONMENT="development" or "production"
DEEPL_KEY=DEEPL API Key for translations
